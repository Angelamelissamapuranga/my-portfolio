              Hi, I am Angela, a junior software developer based in Belgium with
              born and raised in Zimbabwe.I enjoy building clean, functional and
              user-focused digital experiences. I have developed my skills
              through hands on learning, bootcamps and real projects. Working
              with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, responsive design, APIs, React
              and AI tools. I am passionate about learning, solving problems,
              and improving with every project I take on. Since I did not follow
              a traditional university path, I have learned to rely on
              consistency, curiosity, and discipline, and that is what drives me
              in tech. My goal is to grow as a developer, contribute to
              meaningful projects and continue building the kind of work that
              reflects my dedication and potential.
